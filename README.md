**Final Project Overview:**
Our project, "Topics in HIV Research‚Äù explores how the focus of HIV research has shifted across clinical advancements, public health programming, and policy interventions from 2014 to 2024. By analyzing PubMed metadata using functional programming and natural language processing, we identify patterns in keyword trends and topic prevalence over time. We uncover areas of progress and gaps in the research landscape, providing insights that can guide future studies and public health strategies. The results are presented on an interactive Quarto website designed for both general and technical audiences. One section, Results, highlights trends, visualizations, and key findings for those interested in understanding our discoveries, while other sections, Data Collection Demo and Data Cleaning, provide a detailed look at the methods and technical processes behind our analysis.
